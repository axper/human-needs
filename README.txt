=== The big list of business ideas ===

I want to start a business, but don't know what to do and where to start. This list provides inspiration.
I try to find connection between basic human needs (like Maslow's heirarchy of needs), consumer market, professions.

Market research: whether such a list already exists on the internet:
- Only generic idea lists on play store
- Nothing comes up in google that connects human needs to business

Websites used for compiling this list, for inspiration:

- list.am
- stackexchange.com/sites
- www.amazon.com/gp/site-directory/
- gist.github.com/mbejda/19012b99a12e9d014389
- eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/markets_sectors/sectors/sectors_in_market.jhtml

Other:
- People will spend extra on anything related to children/pets
