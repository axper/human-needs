# Connection between human needs and business ideas

I want to start a business, but don't know what to do and where to start. This list provides inspiration.
I try to find connection between basic human needs (like Maslow's heirarchy of needs), consumer market, professions.

## Market research

- Only generic idea lists on play store
- Nothing comes up in google that connects human needs to business

## Inspiration websites

- list.am
- stackexchange.com/sites
